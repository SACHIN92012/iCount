Overview
Entry exit in any building by QR CODE along with its statistical analysis.

Problems with current system 

1.Currently itâ€™s too hard to handle the entry & exit data which is recorded manually, and 
the data can be easily tempered or can be lost.

2.In current system it is hard to analyse about the type of peoples visiting particular 
building and what is their frequency of visiting.

3.In manual system it is also hard to analyse about the timing at which most of the people 
visit . So , by analysis faculties/staffs can be present at that time.


AIM

1.To keep a secured record of how many entries are there, how many left.
2.To find most frequent timing of visiting .
